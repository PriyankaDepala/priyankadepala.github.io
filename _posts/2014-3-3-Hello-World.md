Review of first week at Qubu.


![Review of first week at QuBu]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/deli-pic.jpeg)

(a) What was your first impression of qubu when you first downloaded it.

Initially, I  thought the app looked quite professional and looked well on the home screen. I was quite confused at first on how to use the app but I think that's what it is like with all apps with the first use- the more I used it the simpler it became it to use. However, the app does seem quite blocky- it feels quite monochromatic but it matches to what the logo is. 

(b) What do you think of qubu after this week.

I think Qubu is a great app and has so much potential of becoming a success. However, what I did learn was that there is continuous development and research to make the app perfect for both businesses and customers. From using the app more and more during the week, I had come to realise there was so many elements to get a business up and running and also how much work goes into even adding products.

(c) Name at least one thing you really enjoyed.

Being part of the developmental process has been quite enjoyable particularly seeing small changes being made to the app, whether it being a picture for a business, seeing another business appear on the app or even being able to see an order being placed through.

(d) Name at least 2 things that you didnt like doing.

I think the process of cold calling a lot of pubs has been quite repetitive as a lot of them are closed and hoping that one out of so many pick up was feeling like wasted time- perhaps if we knew what kind of shops were open and called them it would be more beneficial as there was a guarantee answer from them and would be more time efficient.

 Also, when visiting a shop such as Carter's Pharmacy or a business that had no idea we were coming it did feel quite inefficient and improper as they weren't prepared for us to come as they were busy. Whereas, if we did call them beforehand and found a day where both us and them were free on to discuss further information would've seemed a lot more professional and more time effective.

(e) If you could go back in time, what would you do better or avoid doing altogether.

Being able to familliarise myself with more of the behind the scenes of the working of the app such as adding products, adding businesses etc. is something that I would like to become more aware of.

Start of first UX project

The first idea that I had proposed was for the Order accept App, it was to change the look for the app when the app is first opened up.
